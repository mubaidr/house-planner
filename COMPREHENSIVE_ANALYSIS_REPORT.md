2. **Core Features**: All major systems implemented
3. **User Interface**: Complete with sidebars, toolbars, canvas
4. **State Management**: Zustand stores operational
5. **Export Functions**: PDF, DXF, SVG systems in place

## 🚨 Known Issues & Risks

### **High Priority (Development Blockers):**
1. **Jest Configuration**: Tests cannot run (import/export issues)
2. **Production Build**: Type errors prevent production builds

### **Medium Priority (Code Quality):**
1. **ESLint Violations**: 100+ unused variables, hooks issues
2. **Type Safety**: 1064 remaining TypeScript errors
3. **Error Messages**: Many console.log statements need proper error handling

### **Low Priority (Enhancement):**
1. **Performance**: Large files need refactoring (materialRenderer2D.ts - 800+ lines)
2. **Documentation**: Some utility functions lack JSDoc
3. **Configuration**: Hard-coded values need centralization

## 🎪 Manual Testing Protocol

With the dev server running, test these workflows:

### **Basic Functionality Test:**
1. Load application → Should see canvas with toolbars
2. Create wall → Click and drag to draw walls
3. Add door → Place door on wall
4. Add window → Place window on wall
5. Add room → Auto-detect or manually create
6. Apply materials → Select and apply to elements
7. Test export → Generate PDF/DXF

### **Advanced Feature Test:**
1. Multi-view rendering → Switch between Plan/Elevation views
2. Dimension tools → Add measurements
3. Annotation system → Add text labels
4. Template system → Save/load designs
5. Auto-save → Verify data persistence
6. Keyboard shortcuts → Test accessibility

## 📋 Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 days):**
1. **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive feature verification via browser
2. **Jest Fix**: Configure testing infrastructure properly
3. **Critical ESLint**: Fix React hooks violations

### **Short Term (1 week):**
1. **Type Resolution**: Address remaining TypeScript errors systematically
2. **Production Build**: Enable successful production deployment
3. **Performance**: Profile and optimize canvas operations

### **Medium Term (2-4 weeks):**
1. **Code Quality**: Implement code review standards
2. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation
3. **Testing**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
