## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

### Current State
The 2D House Planner is a robust, well-architected Next.js application with:
- Excellent user experience designed for non-technical users
- Strong TypeScript type system and Zustand state management
- Comprehensive feature set for 2D architectural planning
- Professional export capabilities (PDF, images)
- Multi-floor support and material library system

### Recommended Approach
**React Three Fiber + Three.js Ecosystem** provides:
- Seamless integration with existing React/Next.js architecture
- Native Zustand compatibility for state management
- Mature ecosystem with architectural application support
- Maintainable codebase leveraging existing patterns
- Progressive enhancement from 2D to 3D capabilities

### Implementation Strategy
**Progressive Disclosure Approach**:
1. **Foundation Phase**: Core 3D rendering with view mode switching
2. **Element Phase**: 3D versions of walls, doors, windows, rooms
3. **Tools Phase**: 3D measurement, navigation, and interaction tools
4. **Polish Phase**: Materials, lighting, and professional rendering
5. **Advanced Phase**: Complex geometries, environmental effects, and exports

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: 60 FPS, sub-2 second load times
- **Usability**: Non-technical users productive within 5 minutes
- **Compatibility**: All existing 2D features available in 3D mode
- **Professional**: CAD-quality exports for architectural workflows

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Current 2D House Planner application
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Modern browser with WebGL 2.0 support

### Installation
```bash
# Install 3D dependencies
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei @react-three/postprocessing
npm install three leva
npm install --save-dev @types/three

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### First Steps
1. Review [Current Analysis](./01-current-analysis.md) to understand the foundation
2. Follow [Technology Assessment](./02-technology-assessment.md) for library setup
