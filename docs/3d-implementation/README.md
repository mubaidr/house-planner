# 3D House Planner Implementation Plan

> **Comprehensive guide for implementing 3D capabilities in the House Planner application**

---

## üö® Project Foundation Update

**As of August 2025, all 3D features will be developed by extending the architectural concepts and feature set inspired by `CodeHole7/threejs-3d-room-designer`, a React-bundled Three.js room planner and product configurator.**

### Key Project Features of the New Base

- React-bundled Three.js architecture
- Floorplan design with wall drawing
- Room and product configuration
- Real-time 3D rendering

### Customization & Extension Strategy

- All custom features (multi-floor, advanced export, material system, accessibility, etc.) will be layered on top of the base architecture.
- We will maintain compatibility and leverage a React/Three.js approach for all new features.

## üéØ Executive Summary

### Current State

The 2D House Planner is a robust, well-architected Vite + React application with:

- Excellent user experience designed for non-technical users
- Strong TypeScript type system and Zustand state management
- Comprehensive feature set for 2D architectural planning
- Professional export capabilities (PDF, images)
- Multi-floor support and material library system

### Recommended Approach

**React Three Fiber + Three.js Ecosystem** building upon **threejs-3d-room-designer** foundation:

### Core Feature System

Following the proven architecture of threejs-3d-room-designer, our implementation focuses on three main feature areas:

#### 1. **FloorPlan Design** üìê

- Advanced 3D design with top-down view for precise drawing
- Multi-floor support with vertical navigation
- Precision measurement and grid snapping systems
- Advanced geometric operations (boolean, offsetting, etc.)

#### 2. **Room Configuration** üè†

- Interactive product placement in top-down and 3D perspective views
- Real-time positioning, rotation, and scaling
- Collision detection and smart placement assistance
- Room-specific configuration (lighting, materials, ambiance)
- Multi-floor room relationships and connections

#### 3. **Product Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

- Dynamic product dimensions with intelligent morphing
- Advanced material system with PBR textures
- Style variants and configuration presets
- Custom furniture and fixture libraries
- Professional-grade material and finish options

### Implementation Strategy

**Feature-Driven Development Approach**:

1. **FloorPlan Foundation**: Core 3D editing with top-down view for precision
2. **Room System**: 3D room generation and configuration tools
3. **Product Integration**: Furniture placement and customization
4. **Advanced Features**: Materials, lighting, and professional rendering
5. **Professional Tools**: Export, measurement, and presentation features

### Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 60 FPS, sub-2 second load times
- **Usability**: Non-technical users productive within 5 minutes
- **Compatibility**: All existing 2D features available in 3D mode
- **Professional**: CAD-quality exports for architectural workflows

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
