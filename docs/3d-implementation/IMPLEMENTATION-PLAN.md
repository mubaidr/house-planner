# 3D House Planner Implementation Plan

> **Comprehensive implementation plan for building a 3D house planning application using React Three Fiber**

---

## üìã Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for the 3D House Planner application, following the architecture and roadmap defined in the documentation. The plan is organized in progressive phases that build upon each other while maintaining application stability and user experience quality.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Enhance User Experience**: Add 3D visualization without complicating the existing 2D workflow
2. **Maintain Performance**: Ensure 3D features don't degrade existing application performance
3. **Professional Quality**: Deliver architectural-grade 3D rendering suitable for professional use
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support desktop devices with graceful degradation

## üèóÔ∏è Current Status

Based on the README, the foundation phase has been completed with:

- Basic 3D scene with lighting and camera controls
- Wall3D and Room3D components
- View mode switching (2D/3D/Hybrid)
- Zustand state management with Immer
- Basic UI components

## üìÖ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Verified)

‚úÖ **Status**: Verified in repository

**Deliverables (verified in codebase)**:

- ‚úÖ React Three Fiber + Three.js ecosystem integration (`src/components/Canvas3D/Scene3D.tsx`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei` usage)
- ‚úÖ Basic 3D scene with lighting and camera controls (`src/components/Canvas3D/Scene3D.tsx`, `src/components/Canvas3D/Lighting/SceneLighting.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Orbit camera controls with customizable presets (`src/components/Canvas3D/Camera/CameraControls.tsx`, `CameraPresets.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Professional lighting setup (`src/components/Canvas3D/Lighting/SceneLighting.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ View mode switching (2D/3D/Hybrid) (state in `src/stores/designStore.ts`, used by `Scene3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Wall3D component with geometry generation (`src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Wall3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Room3D component with floor/ceiling rendering (`src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Room3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Element selection and hover states (selection implemented via `selectElement` in `src/stores/designStore.ts` and used across 3D elements)
- ‚úÖ Material system with PBR properties (materials defined in `src/stores/designStore.ts`, `useMaterial3D` hook in `src/hooks/3d/useMaterial3D.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive Zustand store with TypeScript (`src/stores/designStore.ts`)

### Phase 2: Core 3D Elements (Partially Verified)

**Objective**: Implement core architectural elements with enhanced 3D representations

Below are items verified in the codebase and remaining gaps discovered during review.

#### 2.1 Door System

#### Week 1: Door Implementation

- ‚úÖ Create `Door3D` component with frame and panel geometry (`src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Door3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Implement wall-attached placement with precise positioning (position math present in `Door3D`)
- ‚úÖ Add opening animations (hinged and sliding handled via useFrame in `Door3D`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Door configuration panel (size, type, material) - UI panel components for door configuration are not present in `src/components/UI` (no dedicated `DoorConfig` or panel file found). Add as a follow-up.

#### 2.2 Window System

#### Week 2: Window Implementation

- ‚úÖ Create `Window3D` component with frame and glass geometry (`src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Window3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Implement wall-attached placement with precise positioning (position math present in `Window3D`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Glazing options (single/double/triple) ‚Äî `Window` type in store includes variants, but the component uses a single material; glazing-level logic/variants and a configuration panel are not implemented in UI.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Window configuration panel (size, type, material) - missing UI panel file.

#### 2.3 Stair System

#### Week 3: Stair Implementation

- ‚úÖ Create `Stair3D` component with steps and railings (`src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Stair3D.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Implement parametric stair generation for straight stairs (step loop present)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: L-shaped, U-shaped, and spiral generation algorithms are not present in `Stair3D` (the `type` exists in the store but component creates straight steps only). Additional parametric generators needed for other types.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Stair configuration panel (type, dimensions, materials) - missing UI panel file.

#### 2.4 Enhanced Wall System

#### Week 4: Wall Enhancements

- ‚úÖ Improve wall connections and corner handling (Wall3D uses connected walls via `getConnectedWalls` helper)
- ‚úÖ Add wall types (load-bearing, partition) (type present in `Wall` store interface)
- ‚úÖ Implement wall openings management (Door3D/Window3D attach to walls and Wall3D geometry adjusts visually)
- ‚úÖ Add wall material assignment (materials supported via `materialId` and `useMaterial3D`)

#### Evidence ‚Äî key implementation files

- `src/stores/designStore.ts` ‚Äî store schemas and actions (walls, doors, windows, stairs, materials, selectElement)
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Scene3D.tsx` ‚Äî main canvas and rendering setup
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Wall3D.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Door3D.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Window3D.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/Stair3D.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas3D/Elements/ElementRenderer3D.tsx`

#### Missing / Gaps (actionable)

1. UI configuration panels for Doors, Windows, and Stairs:

  Doors and Windows are covered by the existing `PropertiesPanel` (`src/components/UI/PropertiesPanel.tsx`) which exposes editable controls for width, height, type, material selectors, and door open state. No separate `DoorConfigPanel`/`WindowConfigPanel` is required unless a dedicated panel is preferred for UX reasons.

  Stairs are not yet covered by `PropertiesPanel` ‚Äî add `StairProperties` rendering (or a dedicated `StairConfigPanel`) to allow editing `steps`, `stepHeight`, `stepDepth`, `width`, `type`, `hasHandrail`, and `railingHeight`.
2. `Stair3D` implements straight stair generation only; L-shaped, U-shaped, and spiral algorithms are TODO.
3. `src/stores/viewStore.ts` was empty ‚Äî a minimal view-store helper has been added to surface `viewMode` and `setViewMode` without changing existing `designStore` ownership. If more view-specific state is required later (camera presets, UI layout for view modes), expand this file.
4. Documentation: update Phase 2 to reflect partial completion and list exact next tasks and owners.
