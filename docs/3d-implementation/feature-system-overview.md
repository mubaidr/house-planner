# Feature System Overview

> **Comprehensive guide to the feature-based architecture following threejs-3d-room-designer patterns**

---

## 🎯 Introduction

Our 3D House Planner implementation follows a feature-based architecture inspired by [CodeHole7/threejs-3d-room-designer](https://github.com/CodeHole7/threejs-3d-room-designer). This approach organizes development around user workflows rather than technical layers, making the system more intuitive to develop, test, and maintain.

## 🏗️ Core Feature Areas

### 1. FloorPlan Design 📐

**Primary Focus**: 3D design with top-down view for precise drawing and placement

#### Key Capabilities

- **3D Design with Top-Down View**
  - Multi-segment wall creation with automatic corner detection in 3D space
  - Curved wall support with parametric control
  - Room boundary management and area calculation
  - Precision drawing tools with grid and angle snapping in top-down mode

- **Multi-Floor Support**
  - Unlimited floor creation with custom naming and heights
  - Vertical circulation (stairs, elevators, ramps)
  - Cross-floor structural relationships
  - Floor-specific visibility and editing controls

- **View Switching**
  - Top-down orthographic view for precise drawing and layout
  - Perspective 3D view for visualization and validation
  - Seamless view transitions with state preservation
  - Performance-optimized rendering for both views

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// FloorPlan feature store structure
interface FloorPlanStore {
  // Core editing state
  currentFloor: number;
  editMode: 'wall' | 'room' | 'opening' | 'measure';
  snapSettings: {
    grid: boolean;
    angle: boolean;
    vertex: boolean;
  };

  // Multi-floor management
  floors: Floor[];
  verticalElements: Stair[] | Elevator[];

  // View management
  activeView: 'topdown' | 'perspective' | 'isometric';
  cameraSettings: CameraConfig;

  // Actions
  createWall: (points: Point[]) => void;
  addFloor: (height: number) => void;
  switchView: (mode: ViewMode) => void;
}
```

### 2. Room Configuration 🏠

**Primary Focus**: Interactive room setup with furniture and environmental controls

#### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Product Placement**
  - Drag-and-drop furniture placement in top-down and 3D perspective views
  - Intelligent collision detection and placement assistance
  - Multi-selection and batch operations
  - Accessibility clearance validation

- **Environment Management**
  - Room-specific lighting design and control
  - Material assignment for walls, floors, and ceilings
  - Style presets and quick room transformation
  - Custom material creation and management

- **Multi-Room Relationships**
  - Door and opening management between rooms
  - Traffic flow visualization and analysis
  - Privacy and noise level configuration
  - Building circulation validation

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Room Configuration feature store
interface RoomConfigStore {
  // Product management
  selectedProducts: Product[];
  productLibrary: ProductCategory[];
  placementMode: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'array';

  // Environment settings
  currentRoom: string;
  lighting: LightingConfig;
  materials: MaterialAssignment[];
  ambiance: AmbianceSettings;

  // Room relationships
  roomConnections: Connection[];
  flowAnalysis: TrafficFlow;

  // Actions
  placeProduct: (product: Product, position: Vector3) => void;
  setRoomMaterial: (surface: string, material: Material) => void;
  analyzeFlow: () => FlowAnalysis;
}
```

### 3. Product Configuration ⚙️

**Primary Focus**: Advanced product customization with materials and dimensions

#### Key Capabilities

- **Dynamic Product Dimensions**
  - Non-uniform scaling with intelligent constraints
  - Morph-based adaptation for complex furniture
  - Real-time dimension feedback and validation
  - Parametric scaling system with proportional relationships

- **Advanced Material System**
  - Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials
  - Surface-specific material assignment
  - Material library with search and categorization
  - Custom material creation with texture import

- **Style Variants and Presets**
  - Predefined style variants per product category
  - User-created configuration presets
  - Style compatibility validation
  - Configuration marketplace integration

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Product Configuration feature store
interface ProductConfigStore {
  // Dimension management
  selectedProduct: Product | null;
  dimensionConstraints: DimensionConstraints;
  morphTargets: MorphTarget[];

  // Material system
  materialLibrary: Material[];
  activeMaterials: MaterialAssignment[];
  customMaterials: CustomMaterial[];

  // Style management
  styleVariants: StyleVariant[];
  activePreset: ConfigurationPreset | null;

  // Actions
  scaleProduct: (dimensions: Dimensions) => void;
  applyMaterial: (surface: string, material: Material) => void;
  savePreset: (name: string, config: Configuration) => void;
}
```

## 🔄 Feature Integration Patterns

### Cross-Feature Communication

Features communicate through a shared event system and normalized data structures:

```typescript
// Shared events between features
type FeatureEvent =
  | { type: 'floorplan:wall_created'; wall: Wall }
  | { type: 'room:product_placed'; product: Product; room: string }
  | { type: 'product:configuration_changed'; product: Product; config: Configuration };

// Normalized data structures
interface SharedState {
  currentProject: Project;
  activeSelection: SelectionState;
  viewState: ViewState;
  undoStack: Operation[];
}
```

### State Synchronization

Each feature maintains its own state while synchronizing through shared data:

- **FloorPlan Changes** → Update room boundaries and product placement validation
- **Room Configuration** → Update lighting and material preview in 3D
- **Product Configuration** → Update dimensions and materials in room context

_Note: All editing operations work directly in 3D space with top-down orthographic view providing precision for drawing and placement tasks._
