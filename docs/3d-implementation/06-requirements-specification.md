## üö® Requirements Foundation Update

**As of August 2025, all 3D requirements will be implemented as extensions or integrations with [CodeHole7/threejs-3d-room-designer](https://github.com/CodeHole7/threejs-3d-room-designer), a React-bundled Three.js room planner and product configurator.**

### Implementation Strategy:

- All requirements below are to be interpreted as customizations, extensions, or integrations with the base project.
- Custom features (multi-floor, advanced export, material system, accessibility, etc.) will be layered on top using the extensibility points provided by the base project.
- Maintain compatibility and leverage the base's React/Three.js architecture for all new features.

## üìù Functional Requirements

Following the proven feature system from threejs-3d-room-designer, our requirements are organized around three core feature areas that align with user workflows and architectural design processes.

Note on constraints (August 2025): For the MVP, we will enforce stricter placement and geometry rules to keep authoring simple and robust:

- Default plan view is top-down orthographic.
- Rooms are formed by orthogonal walls and must close into rectangles/squares (irregular/curved walls can be disabled via a feature flag and added later).
- Doors and windows can only be placed inside host walls and must not extend beyond wall extents.
- Roofs can only be placed/generated on top of a valid building envelope (closed outer walls); no free-floating roofs.
- Walls snap to grid, angles (0/90¬∞ by default), endpoints, midpoints, and existing house edges.
- Multi-room houses are supported; each room must be a closed orthogonal loop.
- Materials are managed per element type (walls, doors, windows, roofs) via a curated library.
