## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Dimensions Not Appearing:**
```
Problem: Clicked two points but no dimension shows
Solution: 
- Check if dimension tool is active (blue button)
- Ensure points are not too close together
- Verify dimension style is set correctly
- Check if dimensions are hidden in visibility panel
```

**Text Annotations Overlapping:**
```
Problem: Text annotations cover each other
Solution:
- Drag annotations to new positions
- Use different text sizes for hierarchy
- Utilize leader lines to move text away from crowded areas
- Layer annotations by category
```

**Area Calculations Incorrect:**
```
Problem: Room area shows wrong value
Solution:
- Check that room is properly enclosed
- Verify walls connect at corners
- Ensure no gaps in wall boundaries
- Recalculate by selecting area and pressing F5
```

**Material Callouts Missing Information:**
```
Problem: Callouts show incomplete material data
Solution:
- Assign materials to elements first in Properties Panel
- Update material library with complete specifications
- Check material properties are filled in
- Refresh callouts with auto-generate function
```

**Export Template Issues:**
```
Problem: Annotations don't appear in exported PDF
Solution:
- Verify annotations are visible before export
- Check template includes annotation layers
- Ensure export quality is set to high
- Try different template if issue persists
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Projects:**
```
- Hide unnecessary annotation categories while working
- Use auto-generate functions instead of manual creation
- Group similar annotations together
- Export in sections for very large buildings
- Save annotation configurations separately
```

### Best Practices

**Professional Results:**
```
1. Plan annotation placement before starting
2. Use consistent dimension styles throughout
3. Group related annotations by color/style
4. Keep text concise and readable
5. Test print readability before final export
6. Save annotation templates for reuse
7. Regular backup of annotation configurations
```
