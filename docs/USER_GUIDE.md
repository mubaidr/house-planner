# User Guide

Welcome to the 2D House Planner! This guide will walk you through the basics of using the application to create your own house designs.

## Getting Started

When you first open the application, you'll see a blank canvas with a grid. This is your drawing area. On the left side of the screen, you'll find the **Elements Sidebar**, where you can select different structural elements to add to your design. On the right side, you'll see the **Properties Panel**, which will show the properties of any element you select.

## Adding and Editing Elements

To add an element to your design, simply click on it in the **Elements Sidebar** and then click on the canvas to place it. You can then move, resize, and rotate the element using the controls that appear when you select it.

To edit the properties of an element, such as its material or dimensions, select the element and then use the **Properties Panel** on the right.

## Using the Toolbar

The **Toolbar** at the top of the screen provides quick access to a variety of tools, including:

- **Alignment Tools**: For precisely aligning elements with each other.
- **Measurement Tools**: For measuring distances and angles.
- **Zoom Controls**: For zooming in and out of the canvas.

## Managing Floors

You can add and switch between different floors of your house using the **Floor Switcher**.

## Saving and Exporting

The application automatically saves your work as you go. You can also export your design to an image or PDF file using the **Export** button in the toolbar.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

A list of available keyboard shortcuts can be found by clicking the keyboard icon in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.
