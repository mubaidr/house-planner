# Task Management Log

## Project Overview
This document tracks the progress, completed tasks, and key decisions for the 2D House Planner Web App project.

## Current Sprint/Phase: Phase 1 - Core Functionality & UI Scaffolding

### Completed Tasks
- Analyzed docs/requirements.md and created docs/llm/project_summary.md
- Set up project dependencies (added Zustand for state management)
- Created TypeScript interfaces for core elements (Wall, Door, Window)
- Implemented Zustand stores for design state and UI state management
- Built main application layout with responsive design (AppLayout component)
- Created drawing canvas with Konva.js integration and zoom/pan functionality
- Implemented toolbar with tool selection and keyboard shortcuts (V, W, D, N, M)
- Built collapsible sidebar for element selection
- Created properties panel for element editing
- Added status bar with grid/snap controls and zoom information
- Implemented grid system with configurable spacing
- Created basic element components (WallComponent, DoorComponent, WindowComponent)
- Built wall drawing tool with snap-to-grid and snap-to-points functionality
- Added save/load functionality with localStorage
- Implemented auto-save feature (every 30 seconds)
- Added keyboard shortcuts for tool switching and canvas controls

### Decisions Made
- Decided to create internal documentation for LLM usage to improve context and accuracy
- Used Zustand for state management due to its simplicity and TypeScript support
- Implemented snap-to-grid and snap-to-points for precise drawing
- Added auto-save functionality to prevent data loss
- Used Konva.js for canvas rendering with React-Konva wrapper
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts following common design tool conventions

### Current Status
Phase 1 is now 100% COMPLETE with all enhancements! The application includes:
- Complete wall drawing with visual snap indicators
- Full wall editing with drag handles for endpoints and moving
- Comprehensive undo/redo system with keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced properties panel with live editing
- Wall deletion with keyboard shortcuts (Delete/Backspace)
- Professional UI with all planned features

### Recently Completed (Phase 1 Polish):**
- Added visual snap indicators with real-time feedback
- Implemented comprehensive undo/redo system with command pattern
- Created wall editing with drag handles for start/end points and moving
- Enhanced properties panel with live property editing (color, thickness, height)
- Added wall deletion functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- Integrated position information and length calculation in properties
- Added proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase

### Pending Tasks/Next Steps

**Phase 2 - Core Drawing Features:**
- Implement door placement tool with wall constraint system
