- Comprehensive undo/redo system with keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced properties panel with live editing
- Wall deletion with keyboard shortcuts (Delete/Backspace)
- Professional UI with all planned features

**Phase 2 Achievements (Recently Completed):**
- Door placement tool with wall constraint system
- Window placement tool with wall constraint system  
- Wall intersection detection and automatic joining
- Measurement tool for distance/dimension display
- Element deletion functionality
- Door animation system with open/close functionality
- Advanced wall constraint validation
- Element movement with wall relationships preserved
- Complete TypeScript type safety
- ESLint compliance with zero warnings/errors

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- 21 React components with full TypeScript support
- 11 custom hooks for complex state management
- Zustand stores for design, UI, and history management
- Command pattern for undo/redo functionality
- Advanced snapping system with grid and element snapping
- Wall constraint system preventing invalid door/window placement
- Konva.js canvas with optimized rendering
- Auto-save functionality with localStorage persistence

### Current Phase 3 Progress

**Completed in Phase 3:**
- Fixed all ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors
- Code quality improvements and optimization
- Comprehensive documentation updates

**Phase 3 - Advanced Features (Remaining):**
- Multi-story support with floor management
- Material library and texture mapping  
- Export functionality (PNG, PDF)
- Advanced alignment and distribution tools
- Room detection and labeling
- Dimension annotation system

### Decisions Made
- Decided to create internal documentation for LLM usage to improve context and accuracy
- Used Zustand for state management due to its simplicity and TypeScript support
- Implemented snap-to-grid and snap-to-points for precise drawing
- Added auto-save functionality to prevent data loss
- Used Konva.js for canvas rendering with React-Konva wrapper
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts following common design tool conventions
- Adopted command pattern for robust undo/redo functionality
- Implemented wall constraint system for realistic door/window placement

### Recently Completed Tasks
- Added visual snap indicators with real-time feedback
- Implemented comprehensive undo/redo system with command pattern
- Created wall editing with drag handles for start/end points and moving
- Enhanced properties panel with live property editing (color, thickness, height)
- Added wall deletion functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- Integrated position information and length calculation in properties
- Added proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- Implemented door placement tool with wall constraints
- Implemented window placement tool with wall constraints
- Added wall intersection detection and automatic joining
- Created measurement tool for distance/dimension display
- Added element deletion functionality
- Implemented door animation system with open/close functionality
- Fixed all ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors

## Implementation Analysis & Recommendations

### Code Quality Assessment
**Current Status: EXCELLENT**
- Zero ESLint warnings/errors
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent code style and patterns

### Architecture Strengths
1. **State Management**: Zustand stores provide clean, predictable state management
2. **Component Architecture**: Well-structured component hierarchy with clear responsibilities
3. **Custom Hooks**: Excellent separation of business logic from UI components
4. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
5. **Command Pattern**: Robust undo/redo system using command pattern
6. **Constraint System**: Advanced wall constraint validation prevents invalid placements

### Performance Optimizations Implemented
- Efficient canvas rendering with Konva.js
- Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useCallback
- Lazy loading of complex calculations
- Debounced auto-save functionality
- Minimal state updates with targeted store actions

### Recommended Improvements & Future Features

#### High Priority Enhancements
1. **Export System**: Implement PNG/PDF export with proper scaling and print layouts
2. **Material Library**: Create comprehensive material database with textures and properties
3. **Room Detection**: Automatic room boundary detection and labeling
4. **Multi-floor Support**: Floor management system with level switching

#### Medium Priority Features
1. **Advanced Measurements**: Permanent dimension annotations with leader lines
2. **Alignment Tools**: Object alignment and distribution utilities
3. **Layer Management**: Separate layers for different element types
4. **Template System**: Save and load common room/house templates

#### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance**: Implement virtualization for large designs
2. **Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly interface adaptation
4. **Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative editing capabilities

#### Code Maintenance
1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Documentation**: API documentation for custom hooks and utilities
3. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
4. **Error Boundaries**: Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Development Best Practices Followed
- Component composition over inheritance
