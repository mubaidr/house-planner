# Test Coverage Requirements

## Overview
Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all functionality and features in the floor plan designer application.

## Current Status
- **Source Files**: 184
- **Test Files**: 42 
- **Coverage Gap**: 77% of files lack tests
- **Overall Coverage**: 15.99% (Target: >80%)

## Priority Areas for Testing

### Critical (0% Coverage - Immediate Priority)
1. **Canvas Elements**: DoorComponent, WallComponent, WindowComponent, RoofComponent, StairComponent
2. **Tool Hooks**: useDoorTool, useWallTool, useWindowTool, useRoofTool, useStairTool
3. **UI Components**: Most components in /components/ui/ have minimal coverage
4. **Renderers**: All 2D rendering components (Plan/Elevation renderers)
5. **Utilities**: Many core utilities like elementTypeConverter, wallJoining2D

### High Priority (Low Coverage)
1. **Canvas Operations**: DrawingCanvas interactions, material application
2. **Export/Import**: File format handling, data validation
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
4. **Error Handling**: Error boundaries, validation

### Medium Priority (Partial Coverage)
1. **Stores**: Expand coverage for floorStore, viewStore, templateStore
2. **Hooks**: Complete coverage for partially tested hooks
3. **Integration**: Component-store interactions

## Requirements (EARS Notation)

### Core Testing Requirements
- **WHEN** any source file exists, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** have corresponding unit tests with >80% coverage
- **WHEN** any component is rendered, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** verify all props, state changes, and user interactions
- **WHEN** any hook is used, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** test all return values, state updates, and side effects
- **WHEN** any store is accessed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** verify all actions, state mutations, and computed values
- **WHEN** any utility function is called, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** test all input/output combinations and edge cases

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **WHEN** components interact with stores, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** verify data flow and state synchronization
- **WHEN** hooks interact with external APIs, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** mock dependencies and test error handling
- **WHEN** canvas operations are performed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** verify rendering and user interactions

### Edge Case Requirements
- **IF** invalid inputs are provided, **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** handle gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **IF** network requests fail, **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide fallback behavior and user feedback
- **IF** canvas operations exceed limits, **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** prevent crashes and maintain stability

## Edge Case Matrix

| Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Invalid canvas dimensions | Frequent | High | 85 | Validate dimensions, provide defaults |
| Memory exhaustion with large designs | Rare | Critical | 90 | Implement pagination, lazy loading |
| Corrupted save data | Occasional | High | 75 | Validate data structure, backup system |
| Network timeout during export | Frequent | Medium | 70 | Retry mechanism, offline fallback |
| Invalid material properties | Frequent | Medium | 65 | Input validation, sanitization |
| Concurrent state updates | Occasional | High | 80 | State management locks, conflict resolution |
| Browser compatibility issues | Frequent | Medium | 70 | Feature detection, polyfills |
| Touch device interactions | Frequent | Medium | 65 | Touch event handling, responsive design |
| Keyboard navigation failures | Occasional | High | 75 | Comprehensive keyboard testing |
| Screen reader compatibility | Frequent | High | 80 | ARIA attributes, semantic HTML |
