# Test Coverage Requirements

## Objective
Build comprehensive test coverage for all major functionality in the floor plan design application to achieve >80% code coverage and ensure reliability.

## Requirements (EARS Notation)

### Core Store Testing
- **WHEN** a user interacts with the design store, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** maintain consistent state for walls, doors, windows, roofs, and rooms
- **WHEN** UI state changes occur, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** properly update tool selection, grid settings, and canvas properties
- **WHEN** materials are applied or removed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** correctly track material applications and maintain library state

### Utility Function Testing
- **WHEN** wall intersections are calculated, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** accurately detect intersection points and handle edge cases
- **WHEN** room detection is performed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** correctly identify enclosed spaces from wall arrangements
- **WHEN** export operations are executed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** generate valid output in multiple formats (PDF, SVG, DXF)

### Hook Testing
- **WHEN** canvas controls are used, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** properly handle zoom, pan, and tool interactions
- **WHEN** element movement occurs, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** maintain element relationships and constraints
- **WHEN** keyboard shortcuts are triggered, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** execute the correct actions

### Component Integration Testing
- **WHEN** the drawing canvas renders, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display all elements correctly with proper visual feedback
- **WHEN** property panels are used, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** update element properties and reflect changes immediately

## Edge Case Matrix

| Edge Case Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Preliminary Mitigation Strategy |
|----------------------|------------|--------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Empty wall arrays in room detection | Frequent | Medium | 60 | Validate input arrays before processing |
| Invalid coordinates in wall intersection | Occasional | High | 75 | Implement coordinate validation and bounds checking |
| Null/undefined materials in applications | Occasional | Medium | 50 | Add null checks and default material fallbacks |
| Concurrent state updates in stores | Rare | High | 80 | Use Zustand's built-in state management patterns |
| Large datasets in export operations | Occasional | Medium | 65 | Implement chunked processing and progress tracking |
| Invalid tool transitions | Frequent | Low | 30 | Add tool state validation |
| Memory leaks in canvas operations | Rare | High | 85 | Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks |

## Success Criteria
- Achieve >80% statement coverage
- All critical paths tested
- Edge cases handled with appropriate error handling
- Integration tests for major workflows
- Performance tests for heavy operations
