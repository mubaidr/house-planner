# Gap Analysis: 2D House Planner Implementation

This document identifies gaps between the current implementation and the requirements specified in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Implemented Features

The following features appear to be implemented based on the code review:

1. **2D House Design**
   - Wall, door, window, roof, and stair components are implemented
   - Room detection is implemented

2. **Material Library**
   - Material management system with categories
   - Material application to elements
   - Material preview and editing

3. **Multi-Story Support**
   - Floor management with floor switching
   - Floor visibility controls
   - Floor duplication and reordering

4. **Interactive Canvas**
   - Drawing canvas with element manipulation
   - Grid system and snap-to-grid
   - Zoom functionality

5. **Save and Load**
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Import/export of designs

6. **Export**
   - Export to PNG and PDF
   - Multi-view export options
   - Template-based export

7. **Precision Tools**
   - Measurement tools
   - Alignment tools
   - Dimension annotations

8. **Multiple Views**
   - View switching between plan, front, back, left, and right perspectives
   - View-specific renderers for each element type

## Missing or Incomplete Features

The following features appear to be missing or incomplete:

1. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - References to `AccessibilitySettingsPanel` and `AlternativeElementList` components exist in `AppLayout.tsx`, but the actual components and `accessibilityStore` are missing
   - WCAG compliance needs verification
   - Keyboard navigation implementation is unclear

2. **Error Handling**
   - References to `ErrorNotification` component and `errorStore` exist, but the actual implementations are missing
   - Comprehensive error handling strategy is not evident

3. **Unit System Support**
   - No clear implementation for switching between metric and imperial units
   - No unit conversion utilities found

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `KeyboardShortcuts.tsx` component exists, but implementation details are unclear
   - No global keyboard shortcut system found

5. **Annotation Export**
   - `handleExportAnnotations` function in `AppLayout.tsx` is a placeholder with a TODO comment

6. **Batch Export Implementation**
   - `handleBatchExport` function in `ExportDialog.tsx` has an undefined `selected` variable
   - Batch export functionality may be incomplete

7. **Documentation**
   - User documentation exists but may need updates to reflect current implementation
   - Developer documentation for extending the application is limited

## Placeholder Functions and TODOs

1. `handleExportAnnotations` in `AppLayout.tsx`:
   ```javascript
   const handleExportAnnotations = () => {
     // Logic to handle exporting annotations
     // TODO: Implement annotation export functionality
   };
   ```

2. Batch export functionality in `ExportDialog.tsx` has an undefined `selected` variable:
   ```javascript
   const handleFloorSelection = (floorId: string) => {
     setSelectedFloors(prev => 
       selected 
         ? [...prev, floorId]
         : prev.filter(id => id !== floorId)
     );
   };
   ```

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - Create `accessibilityStore.ts` to manage accessibility preferences
   - Implement `AccessibilitySettingsPanel.tsx` and `AlternativeElementList.tsx` components
   - Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support
   - Verify WCAG compliance with automated testing tools

2. **Error Handling**
   - Create `errorStore.ts` to centralize error management
   - Implement `ErrorNotification.tsx` component for user-friendly error messages
   - Add error boundaries to prevent application crashes

3. **Unit System Support**
   - Create a `unitStore.ts` to manage unit preferences (metric/imperial)
   - Implement unit conversion utilities
   - Update UI to display measurements in the selected unit system

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Implement a global keyboard shortcut system
   - Complete the `KeyboardShortcuts.tsx` component to display available shortcuts
   - Add keyboard accessibility to all interactive elements

5. **Annotation Export**
   - Complete the annotation export functionality
   - Add options for exporting annotations separately or with the design

6. **Batch Export**
   - Fix the `handleFloorSelection` function in `ExportDialog.tsx`
   - Complete the batch export implementation for multi-floor designs

7. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to reflect current features
   - Add developer documentation for extending the application
   - Include accessibility guidelines for contributors

## Conclusion

The 2D House Planner application has implemented most of the core features specified in the requirements. The main gaps are in accessibility implementation, error handling, unit system support, and some export functionalities. Addressing these gaps will ensure the application meets all the requirements and provides a better user experience.
