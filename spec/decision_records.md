# Decision Records - Test Implementation

## Decision - 2024-12-19T10:30:00Z

**Decision**: Start with fixing critical test failures before expanding coverage
**Context**: Current test suite has 83 failing tests, primarily due to missing exports and configuration issues
**Options**:
1. **Fix existing failures first**: Ensures stable foundation for new tests
2. **Add new tests alongside fixes**: Faster coverage increase but unstable base
3. **Rewrite failing tests**: Clean slate but loses existing good test patterns

**Rationale**: A stable test foundation is essential for reliable CI/CD and development workflow. Fixing existing failures first ensures new tests build on solid ground.
**Impact**: Will delay immediate coverage increase but ensures long-term test reliability
**Review**: Re-evaluate after achieving stable test base

## Decision - 2024-12-19T10:35:00Z

**Decision**: Use chunked implementation approach for comprehensive tests
**Context**: Need to achieve >80% coverage across large codebase with 25+ stores, utilities, and components
**Options**:
1. **Comprehensive single-file approach**: Write all tests for each module at once
2. **Chunked approach**: Write tests in 25-30 line chunks per file
3. **Incremental approach**: Add minimal tests first, then expand

**Rationale**: Chunked approach aligns with workspace file writing best practices and allows for iterative improvement and validation
**Impact**: Enables systematic progress tracking and easier debugging of test issues
