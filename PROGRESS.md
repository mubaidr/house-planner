# House Planner Project Progress Tracking

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the House Planner project through its implementation phases.

## Phase 1: Foundation Phase (Complete ✅)

**Completed**: August 2, 2025

### Core Architecture

- ✅ Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript setup
- ✅ React Three Fiber + Three.js ecosystem integration
- ✅ Zustand state management with Immer
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling system
- ✅ Project structure following documented architecture

### 3D Scene Foundation

- ✅ Basic 3D scene with lighting and camera controls
- ✅ Orbit camera controls with customizable presets
- ✅ Professional lighting setup (ambient, directional, hemisphere)
- ✅ Environment helpers (grid, ground plane)
- ✅ View mode switching (2D/3D/Hybrid)

### Core Elements

- ✅ Wall3D component with geometry generation
- ✅ Room3D component with floor/ceiling rendering
- ✅ Element selection and hover states
- ✅ Material system with PBR properties
- ✅ ElementRenderer3D for managing all 3D elements

### UI Components

- ✅ ViewControls for mode switching and camera presets
- ✅ ToolPanel for adding/removing elements
- ✅ Responsive layout with sidebar and main canvas
- ✅ Real-time render settings controls

### State Management

- ✅ Comprehensive Zustand store with TypeScript
- ✅ Wall, door, window, room, and material management
- ✅ Selection and hover state handling
- ✅ 3D scene configuration management
- ✅ Camera state synchronization

## Phase 2: Core 3D Elements (In Progress 🚧)

**Started**: August 15, 2025

### Completed Features

- ✅ Door3D component with opening animations
- ✅ Window3D component with frame and glass
- ✅ Stair3D component with steps and railings
- ✅ Roof3D component with proper store integration
- ✅ Enhanced wall positioning and geometry cleanup
- ✅ Improved room floor geometry calculation
- ✅ Memory management for 3D geometries

### In Progress Features

- 📝 High-resolution rendering
- 📝 2D floor plan generation from 3D
- 📝 Professional drawing templates

## Technical Improvements Log

### August 18, 2025

- Integrated Roof3D component with design store
- Added proper roof type definitions
- Enhanced room floor geometry calculation with polygon tracing
- Improved memory management for all 3D geometries
- Added roof material support

### August 15, 2025

- Enhanced Stair3D component with individual steps and railings
- Added geometry cleanup to prevent memory leaks in 3D components
- Fixed wall positioning calculation in Wall3D component
- Improved room floor geometry calculation in Room3D component
- Added proper type definitions and memory management

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **2D View**: Not yet implemented (shows placeholder)
2. **Wall Connections**: Corners and junctions need improvement
3. **Export System**: Not yet implemented
4. **Mobile**: Desktop-focused design

## Next Steps

1. Complete enhanced wall connections and corners
2. Implement ceiling rendering for rooms
3. Add more advanced material properties
4. Implement proper roof generation from room walls
5. Begin work on Phase 3: Tools & Interaction
