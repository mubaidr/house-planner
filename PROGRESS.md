- 📝 High-resolution rendering
- 📝 2D floor plan generation from 3D
- 📝 Professional drawing templates

## Technical Improvements Log

### August 18, 2025

- Integrated Roof3D component with design store
- Added proper roof type definitions
- Enhanced room floor geometry calculation with polygon tracing
- Improved memory management for all 3D geometries
- Added roof material support

### August 15, 2025

- Enhanced Stair3D component with individual steps and railings
- Added geometry cleanup to prevent memory leaks in 3D components
- Fixed wall positioning calculation in Wall3D component
- Improved room floor geometry calculation in Room3D component
- Added proper type definitions and memory management

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **2D View**: Not yet implemented (shows placeholder)
2. **Wall Connections**: Corners and junctions need improvement
3. **Export System**: Not yet implemented
4. **Mobile**: Desktop-focused design

## Next Steps

1. Begin work on Phase 5: Export & Professional Features
2. Implement 3D model export (glTF, OBJ, FBX)
3. Add high-resolution rendering and screenshot capture
4. Create 2D floor plan generation from 3D scene
5. Implement multi-floor support with vertical navigation
6. Add walkthrough mode and virtual reality support
7. Create professional drawing templates and documentation
