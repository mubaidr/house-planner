For detailed progress tracking through implementation phases, see [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Add Elements**
   - Click "Add Wall" to create a random wall
   - Click "Add Room" to create a sample room
   - Use "Clear All" to remove all elements

2. **View Controls**
   - Switch between 2D, 3D, and Hybrid views
   - Use camera presets (Top, Front, Perspective, etc.)
   - Toggle shadows, grid, and wireframe mode

3. **3D Navigation**
   - **Orbit**: Left mouse button + drag
   - **Pan**: Right mouse button + drag
   - **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or middle button

4. **Selection**
   - Click on walls or rooms to select them
   - Selected elements show blue highlighting
   - Hover effects show blue tinting

### Render Settings

- **Shadows**: Toggle realistic shadow casting
- **Grid**: Show/hide construction grid
- **Wireframe**: Display wireframe overlay
- **Quality**: Automatic DPR scaling

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### 3D Elements

- **Walls**: Parametric geometry with start/end points, thickness, height
- **Rooms**: Polygon-based floors with optional ceilings
- **Doors**: Animated opening mechanisms (hinged, sliding)
- **Windows**: Frame and glass rendering
- **Stairs**: Individual steps with optional railings
- **Materials**: PBR material system with roughness, metalness, opacity
- **Selection**: Visual feedback with outline and color changes

### Camera System

- **Orbit Controls**: Smooth camera movement with damping
- **Presets**: Pre-defined camera positions and orientations
- **Synchronization**: Store camera state for persistence
- **Constraints**: Prevent camera from going below ground

### Lighting

- **Ambient**: Overall scene illumination
- **Directional**: Shadow-casting sun light
- **Fill**: Reduces harsh shadows
- **Hemisphere**: Natural sky/ground lighting

### Material System

- **Default Materials**: Wall, floor, ceiling materials
- **PBR Properties**: Physically-based rendering support
- **Color System**: Hex color support with material override
- **Extensible**: Ready for texture mapping and advanced materials

## 🛠️ Development Notes

### TypeScript Configuration

- Strict mode enabled for type safety
- Path aliases configured for clean imports
- React 19 types with latest features

### Performance Considerations

- Memoized geometry calculations
- Selective re-rendering with Zustand subscriptions
- LOD (Level of Detail) ready architecture
- Efficient material property updates

### Browser Compatibility

- WebGL 2.0 required
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for desktop use

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **2D View**: Not yet implemented (shows placeholder)
2. **Wall Connections**: Corners and junctions need improvement
3. **Export System**: Not yet implemented
4. **Mobile**: Desktop-focused design

## 🔍 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start development server
2. Test view mode switching
3. Add walls and rooms using tools
4. Test camera controls and presets
5. Verify selection and hover states
6. Check render settings toggles

### Browser Console

- No TypeScript errors
- React Three Fiber canvas logs
- Selection events logged for debugging
